This is an IceStorm version ready to build.
It does not require any other tools to be installed except IceStorm tools.

Build it with the "compile" script. You will get the bitstream binary "j1a0.bin".

While iCE40UP5K variant in IceStorm is still experimental, the arachne-pnr shoots errors sometimes when messing with source.
Needs some investigation therefore.

Not tested on real HW yet.
