This is an IceStorm version ready to build.
It does not require any other tools to be installed except IceStorm tools.

Build it with the "compile" script. You will get the bitstream binary "j1a0.bin".

Since iCE40UP5K variant in IceStorm is still an experimental version, the arachne-pnr 
shoots errors when messing with source. Needs some investigation therefore.
Icetime indicates an issue too.

Not tested on real HW yet unless the UP5k version will be stable.
