UPduino Mecrisp-Ice with full 15kB block ram.
---------------------------------------------

An Experimental version of the Mecrisp-Ice Forth running on the J1a 16bit processor.

This is an IceStorm version for UP5k/15kB ready to build.

It does not require any other tools to be installed except the latest IceStorm tools.

The ram source contains the nucleus.fs image (from Mecrisp-Ice).

The size is 541-557 PLBs, and the timing estimate 32 - 40MHz based on the arachne seed.

Build it with the "compile" script. You will get the bitstream binary "j1a0.bin".
